# Budget App

This is the boilerplate for the Budget App project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/budget-app.

## Python program

Budget is a Python program that allows users to track their spending and categorize their expenses. This program uses the Category class to create budget categories, such as food, clothing, and entertainment. The Category class has methods to deposit and withdraw funds, as well as to transfer funds to other categories. Additionally, it has a method to generate a chart that displays the percentage of spending in each category. 

## Getting Started

To get started with Budget, clone the repository and run main.py. This file contains an example of how to use the Category class to create and manage budget categories. 

## Usage

The Category class is used to create budget categories. Each category is instantiated with a name. The Category class contains methods for depositing and withdrawing funds from the category, as well as transferring funds to other categories. Additionally, it contains a method for generating a chart that displays the percentage of spending in each category. 

## Bug Fixes 

If you encounter any bugs while using Budget, please create an issue and we will work to fix them as soon as possible. 

## Testing 

Unit tests have been written to ensure that the Category class functions as expected. Currently, my tests are failing, so if you are able to help fix the issue, please create a pull request with your updates.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
